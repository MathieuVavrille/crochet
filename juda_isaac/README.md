# Juda's head (The binding of isaac)

![alt text][front.png "front"] ![alt text][back.png "back]

## Material

I wanted a beige wool but I didn't have one, so I used something between white and yellow.

Moreover, you need red, black, white, blue and 2cm of yellow

## Pattern

### Fez

Do 6 sc in a magic knot, and then two ranks with one increase on each. Add a black thread on top of the fez and a yellow thread after the black one.

### Body

The body is a simple ball but with less normal ranks in the middle (one less, to have more an ellipsis than a sphere).

### Eyes and Mouth

The eyes and mouth are a magic knot with 6 sc.

### Tears

The tears are a chain of 10 (if I remember), and then sc back to the beginning.

### End

Sew everything, add white wool for the mouth and eyes.

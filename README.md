## My crochet personal folder

Here are most of the things that I did in crochet.

I try to give the patterns, mainly if I modified a lot of things.


## Notations

sc = single crochet
sl st = slip stitch
ch = chain



## Things that I don't want to say again

To crothet in circle :
- start with a magic knot, do N sc, do a sl st in the fist sc
- ch, sc in the same stitch. then do the number that you need, and sl st in the first sc of the round.

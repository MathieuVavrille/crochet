## My crochet personal folder

Here are most of the things that I did in crochet.

I try to give the patterns, mainly if I modified a lot of things.
It will be really small explanations, just that you can understand the idea of the work. When I took the pattern from internet I give the reference, otherwise I just did it myself.

## Notations

sc = single crochet
sl st = slip stitch
ch = chain



## Tutorials

### To crothet in circle

- start with a magic knot, do N sc, do a sl st in the fist sc
- ch, sc in the same stitch. then do the number that you need, and sl st in the first sc of the round.

### To do a rank increase

What I call rank increase is a way to turn a cylinder such that it will be curved. To do it start by doing circles of the same size. Then about when you want to turn, just do 4 stitches, then turn back, do 4 stitches on the ones you did, and keep on on the same direction. When arriving after the 4 stitches of the beginning, turn back once more and keep on as usual.

It is easier to do when working in spiral, but it is also possible in rounds.

### To do a ball

My way to do a ball is to do a magic knot with 6 sc, then aug on the rank, then (sc, aug), then (sc, sc, aug), ... Then you do normal ranks (the same number as the number of augmenting ranks). Then you decrease.

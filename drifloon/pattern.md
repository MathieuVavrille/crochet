## Pattern

### Requirements

Wool:
- Purple (for the body, the big part)
- Yellow (nose and ~hands~)
- White (cloud)
- Black (arms and eyes)

### Best order for the parts

I advise to start the body, but leave it open to add the cloud, nose and eyes. Then it can be closed.


### Body

In purple, in single crochet:

In circles: increase by 8 every round until 48 stitches, then 13 rounds of 48 stitches, then decrease by 8 every round.

### Cloud



### Nose

In yellow. The goal is to make a cross in two straight lines.

First line:
Do 3 rows of 9 sc, going back and forth starting from a chain.

The second line is divided in two to avoid the nose to be bigger in the center where the two parts will overlap. Do 3 rows of 3 sc (back and forth), then 6 chains and then 3 rows of 3 sc (back and forth).
